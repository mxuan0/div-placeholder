I am a machine learning researcher trying to figure out the important concepts of the group of images that capture the group's diveristy so I can better understand my data. 
I generated a list of attributes that are likely to be true for the group:
"people"
"fashion items"
"household objects"
"technology"
"animals"
"nature"
"text"
"vehicles"
"food"
"buildings"

For each attribute, come up with 3 distinct sub-concepts that are likely to be true for the group of images. Please write a list of captions (separated by bullet points "*") following each parent attribute. For example:
"vehicles"
* "cars"
* "bicycles"
"animals"
* "birds"
* "pets"
"people"
* "facial expressions"
* "a joyful atmosphere"
"outdoor scenes"
* "mountains"
* "lakes"

Do not talk about the caption, e.g., "caption with one word" and do not list more than one concept. The hypothesis should be a caption, so hypotheses like "more of ...", "presence of ...",
"images with ...", "images of ..."  are incorrect. Also do not enumerate possibilities inside parenthesis. Do not directly list the image captions as sub-attributes. Instead, summarize the key concepts from the captions. 
Do not enumerate possibilities with or, so captions include "a or b" are incorrect. Here are examples of bad outputs and their corrections, do not produce answers similar to INCORRECT answers:
* INCORRECT: "various nature environments like lakes, forests, and mountains" CORRECTED: "nature"
* INCORRECT: "images of household object (e.g. bowl, vacuum, lamp)" CORRECTED: "household objects"
* INCORRECT: "Presence of baby animals" CORRECTED: "baby animals"
* INCORRECT: "cartoons or animated images" CORRECTED: "cartoons"
* INCORRECT: "images with clothing or fashion items" CORRECTED: "fashion items"
* INCORRECT: "Different types of vehicles including cars, trucks, boats, and RVs" CORRECTED: "vehicles"
* INCORRECT: "Images involving interaction between humans and animals" CORRECTED: "interaction between humans and animals"
* INCORRECT: "More realistic images" CORRECTED: "realistic images"
* INCORRECT: "images of text or labels" CORRECTED: "text"
* INCORRECT: "boats or kayaks in water" CORRECTED: "boats in water"

Again, I want to figure out what kind of distribution the group of images has. List properties that hold often for the images (not captions) in the group. Answer with a list
(separated by bullet points "*") for each parent attribute. Your response
